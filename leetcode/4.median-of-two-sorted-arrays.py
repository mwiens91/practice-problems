    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: list[int], nums2: list[int]) -> float:
        # NOTE: needed to use Neetcode to figure out how to do this in
        # O(log(m + n)) time complexity. Note that the actual solution
        # has the even smaller time complexity O(log(min(m,n))).

        # General idea: Suppose for simplicity that m + n is odd. Then
        # if we merged both arrays of numbers, the median would be the
        # middle number such that an equal number of elements lie on
        # both sides of it. We can find this median without formally
        # merging by partitioning the smaller array into left and right
        # partitions; once this is chosen we automatically know how to
        # partition the larger array based on the size of the left and
        # right partitions of the smaller array. If the partitions
        # satisfy the property that every number on either left
        # partition is <= every number on either right partition, then
        # the median is the smallest number of the combined right
        # partition (if we take the rule that the right partition
        # contains one greater element than the left for m + n odd,
        # which we will here). The idea is that the combined left
        # partition represents all elements to the left of the median of
        # the theoretically merged array, while the combined right
        # partition represents all elements to the left of and including
        # the median of the theoretically merged array.
        #
        # Let's look at an example. Suppose the smaller array was
        #
        # 2 3 4
        #
        # and the larger array was
        #
        # 1 4 5 7.
        #
        # If we partition the smaller array as
        #
        # 2 | 3 4
        #
        # then since m + n = 7, 3 elements must lie on each side of the
        # median in the theoretical merged array. Thus the larger array
        # must be partitioned as
        #
        # 1 4 | 5 7.
        #
        # A given partition is valid if all elements in the left
        # partitions are less than or equal to all elements in the right
        # partitions. In this case the partitioning scheme shown above
        #
        # 2   | 3 4
        # 1 4 | 5 7
        #
        # is not valid because 4 > 3 but 4 is part of the left
        # partitions and 3 is part of the right partitions. Instead, a
        # valid partitioning scheme would be
        #
        # 2 3 | 4
        # 1   | 4 5 7.
        #
        # We can find a valid partitioning scheme efficiently by running
        # a binary search on the smaller array. Let s_l, s_r be the
        # values to the left and right of the smaller array separator,
        # and let l_l, l_r be the corresponding values for the larger
        # array.
        #
        # If l_s > r_l, then we know the left partition of the smaller
        # array is too large, and we need to move the separator to the
        # left. If l_l > r_s, then there we need to move the separator
        # to the right. If neither of those conditions are true, then a
        # partition is valid.
