        # try to expand as far as possible in either direction. This

        # found with a simple modification.

        # approach that I haven't implemented. Start from the middle of

        # centre as possible when doing subsequent checks: this will
        # allow us to return early because in some cases we will find
        # the longest theoretically possible substring. Again though:
